## 🔗 How Internal Links Work

This vault uses Obsidian's wiki-style linking:
- `[[lecture-w02-data-handling-content]]` - Links to lecture files
- `[[lab-w02-solutions]]` - Links to lab solutions
- Links work across folders automatically
- Hover over links to preview content

## 🤝 Collaboration Guidelines

### Good Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Pull before you start working (`git pull`)
- Commit regularly with clear messages
- Add new notes in the appropriate course/folder
- Use the templates in `_templates/` for consistency

❌ **DON'T:**
- Commit large binary files (datasets, PDFs)
- Delete others' personal notes
- Reorganize folder structure without discussion

### Handling Merge Conflicts

If you both edit the same file:
1. Git will notify you of a conflict
2. Open the file and look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`)
3. Keep the changes you want
4. Commit the resolved file
