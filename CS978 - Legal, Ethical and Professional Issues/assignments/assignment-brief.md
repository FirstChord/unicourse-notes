CS978 Legal, Ethical & Professional Issues for the Information Society 2025  
Team assignment (80% of final mark for the module)  
Brief  
Your team’s task is to author and deliver an up-to-date video presentation aimed at  
computer science/information systems professionals. The purpose of the presentation to  
inform those professionals about the ethical and legal issues related to privacy that they  
need to understand to undertake their duties in a professional manner, bearing in mind  
their legal and ethical responsibilities to their employers, profession, and wider society.  
You are free to target any subset within the computer science/information systems  
community, (e.g., data science professionals, software engineers, health informatics  
professionals) however, you should ensure the presentation is written with the particular  
interests of that group in mind. Be clear in your presentation who you are targeting.  
The presentation should not merely rehash information from the lectures. It is important  
that you read well on the topic e.g., academic papers, legal cases, government and industry  
reports, and assemble the presentation for the chosen audience. Think of the issues that  
someone in your chosen profession should know related to privacy. Consider how these  
would impact the design and implementation of services. Also consider all of the ethical  
approaches to privacy that are relevant and inform your audience about them.  
Peer-review will be incorporated into the assignment: a form will be circulated following the  
assignment for team members to highlight any successes or challenges the team faced,  
anonymously. Marks may be adjusted up/down in light of team feedback on individual  
contributions. To that end, it is advisable to begin work on the team assignment as soon as  
possible. Do not leave the work until the last minute, as this is often where team  
assignments become problematic.  
The completed assignment should be submitted in the form of a video presentation lasting  
no more than 10 minutes. Any content past the 10 minute mark will not be considered  
when marking. You should also submit any materials created such as Powerpoint slide  
decks.  
Feel free to be creative in how you produce the presentation (i.e. use of images/diagrams)  
but remember to respect the copyright of others. You should not use AI-generated images.
