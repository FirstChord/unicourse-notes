**Team Brief: Privacy in AI Model Training – Ethical & Legal Perspectives**

**Objective**  
Target audience: Regulatory bodies and companies developing AI products.  
Deliverables: A well-researched, professionally narrated presentation with visual slides and APA-formatted references.

**Legal Perspective (Team Members 1–3)**  
**1\. Legal Foundations and Frameworks**  
Focus: Explain the legal pillars governing data privacy — GDPR, UK Data Protection Act 2018, and EU Artificial Intelligence Act (2024). What is privacy?  
Key Points: Lawful basis for data processing (Art. 6 GDPR), purpose limitation, data minimisation, and accountability.  
References: GDPR; EU AI Act; ICO AI and Data Protection Guidance (2023).

**2\. Lawful Data Use and Consent Challenges**  
Focus: Analyse how AI companies gather training data (e.g., web-scraping, public datasets) and whether consent or legitimate interest applies.  
Key Issues: Transparency, notice requirements, and Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs).  
Case Example: ChatGPT (Italy, 2023\) – temporary suspension for inadequate transparency.  
References: Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali (2023); Selbst & Powles (2017).

**3\. Sensitive & Biometric Data \+ Enforcement**  
Focus: Discuss special-category data (biometric, health, children’s data) and recent enforcement actions.  
Case Example: Clearview AI fined under GDPR for scraping facial images without consent.  
References: Reuters (2022); GDPR Articles 9–10.

**Ethical Perspective (Team Members 4–6)**  
4\. **Ethical Theories and Privacy Values**   
Focus: Apply ethical frameworks (Deontology, Utilitarianism, Virtue Ethics, Data Ethics).  
Key Question: Is it morally justified to use publicly available personal data for AI training?  
References: Floridi (2013); Mittelstadt et al. (2016).

**5\. Professional Responsibility and Codes of Conduct      (Izaj)**  
Focus: Connect ethical obligations to professional codes (ACM, BCS, IEEE).  
Key Points: Integrity, accountability, and duty to disclose unethical practices.  
Deliverable: 1 slide summarising how engineers can act ethically within organisations.  
References: BCS (2021) Code of Conduct; ACM Ethics Guidelines (2020).

**6\. Governance & Policy Recommendations**  
Focus: Integrate both legal and ethical insights into actionable recommendations for regulators and AI companies.  
Recommendations(examples):  
Conduct DPIAs before dataset use.  
Implement differential privacy and federated learning  
Maintain dataset provenance and audit logs.
