# Assignment FAQs

Frequently Asked Questions  
What should I include in “Identification and description of key challenge(s) or  
problem(s) to be addressed”?  
In this section, you are expected to clearly define the core issues or challenges that your project aims  
to address. These challenges should align with your research questions, which you will attempt to  
answer through your analysis. Begin by introducing the broader context of the topic \- why this area is  
important and why the problems you've chosen matter. Discuss existing work or research done on  
this topic, including any gaps or areas that remain unresolved. Your justification should explain why  
solving these problems is interesting or beneficial (e.g., how it could impact decision-making, provide  
insights, or lead to practical applications). Clearly articulating the goals of your research helps frame  
your entire project and ensures that your work remains focused.  
What should I include in “Introduction to the dataset”?  
The dataset introduction should provide a comprehensive overview of the data you are working with.  
This includes the source of the dataset (e.g., where it was collected from, who collected it, and when,  
if available) and a detailed description of the features or variables included. You should mention the  
type of data (e.g., numerical, categorical, time series) and provide basic characteristics such as the  
number of observations and key variables. Additionally, you should explain why you selected this  
particular dataset and how it aligns with your research questions or problems. This rationale could be  
based on factors like the dataset’s relevance, reliability, size, or richness of information. If applicable,  
discuss any pre-processing steps you undertook (e.g., cleaning, normalizing data) to prepare the  
dataset for analysis.  
How many different types of graphs should I use in “Summary statistics (including  
figures) for data being analysed”?  
The number of different types of graphs is less important than the clarity and relevance of the  
visualizations you include. In this section, the goal is to use figures and summary statistics to provide  
insights into the structure of your dataset, helping to explain the relationships between key variables  
and their potential to answer your research questions. You should include graphs that are well-suited  
to highlighting specific patterns in your data, such as histograms for distribution, scatter plots for  
relationships between variables, or box plots for outlier detection. Focus on producing visualizations  
that enhance the understanding of the dataset’s characteristics in relation to the research problems,  
rather than merely showcasing different types of charts. Aim for clarity and quality of interpretation  
over quantity. Additionally, you may want to include summary statistics like means, medians, and  
standard deviations where relevant.  
What should I add in “Reflection on methods used for analysis”?  
In the "Reflection on methods used for analysis" section, you should provide a thoughtful evaluation  
of the effectiveness and limitations of the techniques and models used in your project. Reflect on how  
well the graphs and summary statistics helped you explore the dataset and whether they successfully  
highlighted key trends or patterns. Similarly, discuss your choice of machine learning models,  
explaining why you selected certain algorithms and how well they performed in answering your  
research questions. This includes evaluating model performance using relevant metrics and  
considering whether the results met your expectations. Additionally, address any limitations you  
encountered, such as dataset constraints or model assumptions, and suggest potential improvementsor alternative approaches that could enhance the analysis. The focus should be on critically assessing  
the methods rather than simply summarizing the outcomes.  
Which dataset should I choose?  
Before choosing a dataset, you should first identify a topic that interests you and aligns with the  
research questions or problems you want to address. The dataset you choose should be relevant to  
that topic and allow for meaningful analysis. Take your time in selecting both the topic and the dataset,  
as these decisions will shape your entire project.  
Avoid using time series datasets, as they often require specialized techniques that may not be suitable  
for this coursework. Similarly, avoid datasets with very few relevant features, as this may limit the  
depth of your analysis. Before finalizing your choice, conduct some exploratory analysis on potential  
datasets to ensure they are rich enough for the types of insights you aim to uncover and align well  
with your intended methods and research objectives.  
The dataset is too small or too large; what should I do?  
If the dataset is too small, consider finding another dataset on a similar topic to merge with your  
current one. This can help provide more data points and make your analysis more robust. Be mindful  
of the compatibility between the datasets, such as matching features or variables. If the dataset is too  
large, you can focus on a subset of the data, either by sampling or by selecting relevant features or  
time periods. In both cases, make sure to clearly explain any adjustments you made in your report,  
including how and why you combined datasets or reduced the dataset size. This transparency is  
important for understanding your approach and ensuring the integrity of the analysis.  
Is it fine to work on a fake dataset, or should I search for a real dataset?  
Working with a real dataset is definitely preferred, as it provides more practical and relevant  
experience. Real datasets often come with complexities like missing data or noise, which are valuable  
to learn how to handle. However, for the purposes of this coursework, it is acceptable to use a "fake"  
or synthetic dataset, such as those found on Kaggle. These can still provide meaningful insights and  
allow you to demonstrate your analytical and machine learning skills. Just ensure that the dataset you  
choose aligns with your research questions and allows for a thorough analysis.  
Can I request an extension based on late arrival?  
Yes, you can request an extension if you arrived late. However, if you're working in a group, all group  
members must be in similar circumstances for the extension to be approved. For instance, if you  
arrived in week 3 but your group members have been present since the beginning, you cannot request  
an extension for the coursework. In such cases, you should either work alone or join a group of  
students who also arrived late for the extension to be granted. The length of the extension depends  
on the circumstances of all students in the same group.  
In the "sample submission \- Part I" provided on MyPlace, they have used more than  
one supervised and unsupervised method. Can we do the same for this coursework?  
For this coursework, you are required to include only one supervised learning method and one  
unsupervised learning method in your report. While previous assignments may have allowed students  
to present multiple methods in each category, the current guidelines specify that you should focus on  
just one of each. If you include more than one supervised or unsupervised method in your report, only  
one method (typically the first) from each category will be marked, and the others will be disregarded.  
However, this doesn't mean you are restricted to trying only one method of each type in your code.  
You are encouraged to experiment with multiple supervised and unsupervised algorithms during youranalysis to determine which ones yield the best results for your dataset and research questions. This  
experimentation can help you understand the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.  
Ultimately, you should select the most appropriate supervised and unsupervised methods based on  
your findings and present only those in your report. Make sure to provide a detailed analysis, results,  
and reflection on the methods you choose to include.  
Can we use ML models not covered in this module?  
While we recognize that some students may have prior experience with machine learning and that  
advanced ML models could potentially yield better results, it is essential to maintain fairness in  
assessments for all students. Therefore, you should only use models that have been covered in this  
module for your coursework. If you choose to implement advanced models, such as deep learning  
techniques or other models not discussed in class, these will not be marked. It is important to adhere  
to the guidelines provided in the module to ensure that your work is evaluated appropriately based  
on the materials and methods taught.  
Can we work in a group for the second part of the coursework?  
Group work is only permitted for the first part of the coursework. For the second part, you are required  
to work individually, and group work is strictly prohibited. Engaging in group work for the second part  
of the coursework will be considered a breach of the guidelines and could result in students being  
invited to academic misconduct meetings. It is essential to adhere to these rules to ensure a fair and  
equitable assessment process.  
Can a group have students from CS982 and CS989?  
Unfortunately, this is not possible for administrative reasons. Group members must be from the same  
module.  
Can we use GenAI tool, such as chatGPT or others?  
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT should only be used as part of your learning process – specifically for  
improving and refining your work, not for generating content or code for your coursework. For  
example, it’s acceptable to use AI to enhance the clarity and structure of your writing, make your  
arguments more concise, or troubleshoot errors in your code. However, using AI tools to generate the  
main content or any part of your assignment or code is strictly prohibited and will be considered a  
breach of guidelines. This could result in students being invited to academic misconduct meetings.  
The focus of the evaluation will be on your thinking, creativity, and problem-solving process, not just  
the final product. While AI tools can be helpful for students who may struggle with articulating their  
ideas, it's important to use them only for guidance and improvement. The core ideas and work must  
remain your own. Always ensure that the thought process behind your work is original, as that is what  
your work will be graded on.
