# Assignment Brief

CS982 Big Data Technologies / CS989 Big Data Fundamentals:  
Coursework (Part I & Part II)  
Part I – Create (70% of the coursework mark)  
AIM OF THE ASSIGNMENT  
To deepen students’ understanding of methodological approaches to processing and analysing data;  
and to build appreciation of practical and conceptual challenges in real-world data analysis.  
LEARNING OUTCOMES  
Apply fundamental Python programming skills to engage with a range of big data technologies and  
tools; Explain and evaluate the use of classical statistical techniques in modern data analysis contexts;  
Assess the suitability of different data analysis methods and technologies for specific problem  
domains, considering both their capabilities and limitations.  
TEAM  
You may submit individually or as a group (maximum 3 students). Please use the MyPlace activity  
“Coursework \- Part I \- Group Selection” to select your group, even if you are going to work alone. If  
you are working in group, all students must work together and equally on all the questions, and the  
work cannot be divided between the students.  
SUBMISSION  
The report to be submitted should be 2500 words (+/- 10%) excluding the front cover, table of content,  
list of figure / tables, and appendices. The document must be in pdf format. All code used for the  
analysis is also to be submitted, if not submitted the submission will be considered incomplete and a  
late penalty will be applied until all components of the assessment are submitted; More details will  
be available on the submission page on MyPlace. Both the code and the report should be submitted  
using MyPlace; no submission will be accepted in any different way.  
EXTENSION  
Extensions should be requested in advance of the submission deadline, via MyPlace, with a valid  
reason. Assessments submitted after the deadline without an approved extension will be subject to  
penalties on a sliding percentage scale: 10% for the first 24hrs, and 5% for each additional day.  
Penalties will be applied to late submitted assessments up until four days, and assessments submitted  
after four days of the deadline will receive a mark of zero.  
For extensions longer than 3 days, you must add a self-certificate1 on Pegasus to support the  
extension, otherwise the request for an extension will be rejected.  
DEADLINE

THE BRIEF  
Provide a report on the analysis of an open dataset. There are some restrictions on the dataset that  
can be selected (see below “DATASET RULES”). You can focus your report on one aspect of the dataset  
or multiple aspects, the main objective is to find some interesting questions or problems to answer.  
The following criteria will be used when marking your assignment:  
• Identification and description of key challenge(s) or problem(s) to be addressed • Introduction to the dataset • The challenge(s)/problem(s) is (are) to be addressed using the following  
o Summary statistics (including figures) for data being analysed o Description, rationale, application and findings from only one unsupervised analysis method covered in the module  
o Description, rationale, application and findings from only one supervised analysis method covered in the module  
• Conclusion & Reflection on methods used for the analysis • Structure presentation, and proper citation of references DATASET RULES  
Example datasets are available on:  
➢ The UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php  
➢ Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets  
You can also select a dataset from other sources, but make sure that the dataset is public and that you  
have the right to access and analyse the dataset and to share the results.  
However, you cannot select a dataset that satisfies one of the rules below. Submitted projects on one  
of these datasets will receive a mark of zero.

Part II – Evaluate (30% of the coursework mark)  
AIM OF THE ASSIGNMENT  
To provide a deeper understanding of appropriate methodological approaches to processing and  
analysing data; and to encourage appreciation of the challenges involved in data analysis.  
LEARNING OUTCOMES  
Evaluate the use of classical statistical techniques in modern data analysis contexts; Assess the  
suitability of different data analysis methods and technologies for specific problem domains,  
considering both their capabilities and limitations.  
TEAM  
Groupwork for this part is not allowed. Students are expected to work individually.  
SUBMISSION  
➢ Download the template file, "templateEvaluation.xlsx", from MyPlace.  
➢ Edit the file using Microsoft excel or any other editor that allows editing xlsx files. You should  
add 3 different values:  
o Cell A3 – your 9‑digit registration number.  
o Cell A7 – your Evaluation mark for Part I (a number from 0 to 100).  
o Cell A11 – your Justification (maximum 1000 words). The justification should be a  
structured, evidence‑based explanation of why your chosen mark reflects the marking  
scheme.  
➢ Save and upload your completed templateEvaluation.xlsx to MyPlace before the deadline.  
Note that the template file is protected with password so it doesn't allow you to change the format of  
the template file. The use of the template will allow us to automatically collect all answers, therefore  
please make sure to use the template, otherwise your submission might not be considered for  
marking.

THE BRIEF  
The Evaluation activity enables you to evaluate your report using the "Marking scheme" file and assign  
an expected mark for the first part of the assignment, accompanied by a justification.  
• Expected mark: Please take your time in reviewing the “Marking Scheme” file to determine the  
appropriate mark for the first part on a scale of 0 to 100\. Then this mark will be used in a specific  
formula to calculate the mark for this part of the assignment, as explained below:  
𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝐼𝐼 \= 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 (100 ∗ (1 − (|𝑋𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡− 𝑋𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑟|  
50 \+ |50 − 𝑋𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑟|)))  
o Xstudent is the mark for the first part provided by the student,  
o Xmarker is the mark for the first part provided by the marker,  
o | … | is the absolute value,  
o round is the function used to round the output to the nearest integer.  
You score higher when your estimate is close to the marker’s mark. The denominator scales the  
penalty so that differences are treated fairly whether the marker’s mark is near the top or bottom  
of the scale.  
Consider the following example:  
o Suppose the marker gives Part I a mark of 70 (X\_marker \= 70).  
o You enter 75 (X\_student \= 75).  
o Absolute difference: |75 \- 70| \= 5\.  
o Denominator: 50 \+ |50 \- 70| \= 50 \+ 20 \= 70\.  
o Fraction: 5 / 70 ≈ 0.0714286.  
o 1 − fraction ≈ 0.9285714.  
o Multiply by 100: 92.85714.  
o Rounded → 93\.  
• Justification: The justification should be based on your understanding of the criteria outlined  
in the marking scheme, highlighting how well the report aligns with each criterion.  
Additionally, it should demonstrate your ability to critically evaluate the work and provide  
constructive feedback for future enhancements. Hence, it is imperative that you invest  
adequate time in reviewing the “Marking Scheme” file and provide a well detailed justification  
for the proposed mark. Although the justification itself does not bear a separate mark, its  
quality may affect your mark for this part. To clarify, failure to provide a justification will result  
in a zero mark for part II, while a generic or superficial justification may lead to a deduction of  
half (or more) the mark. Therefore, endeavour to craft a comprehensive justification that  
articulates your assessment with precision and clarity.
