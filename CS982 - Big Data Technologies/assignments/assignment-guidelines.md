# Report Guidelines

Report Style and Layout  
Font  
Submissions should use an 11- or 12-point font, 1.5 line spacing and have either indented paragraphs,  
or paragraphs separated by a single line or equivalent spacing. Leave a good margin all around. Use a  
font that is clear and easy on the eye (e.g. sans-serif fonts such as Ariel, Calibri and Verdana), and  
avoid exotic fonts such as those that represent handwriting.  
Length of Report  
Reports should be 2500 words (+/-10%) in length excluding front cover, table of content, list of  
figure / tables, and references appendices.  
Development Details  
Details on packages used, development environment and software versions should be included on the  
cover page or as an appendix. If not included marks will be deducted.  
References  
References should be made to any quotations given in the work, and to any concepts, ideas, facts,  
data, etc., which you derive from the work of others, whether in the form of quotation or not.  
References in the text should follow the Harvard style. Provide details of the author(s), date, in  
brackets at the point of citation, with the page number if the reference is to a monograph, e.g.: The  
call for a free flow of information between nations is laudable, but in reality the flow is often dictated  
or controlled by the most wealthy countries and commercial organisations (Usher, 2006, p.52);  
or: As Usher (2006, p.52) has pointed out, the call for a free flow of information between  
nations is laudable, but in reality the flow is often dictated or controlled by the most wealthy  
countries and commercial organisations. Both citation styles are acceptable, but choose one and be  
consistent in its application. You should provide a single alphabetically ordered list of works consulted  
or cited, with inclusive page numbers for articles, etc.  
Quotations  
Short quotations (up to 2 lines) should be included in the text, in double quote marks. Longer  
quotations should be placed as a separate paragraph, without quote marks, and indented, e.g.: Short  
quotation; Drybrush (2002) suggests that â€œmerely documenting procedures is insufficient; you must  
also have proof that you do what you say." Long quotation; In discussing the relationship between  
society and information technologies, Hamelin has pointed out that:  
The question arises whether the historical process in which informatisation evolves from  
mechanisation implies fundamental changes in the social structures in which it takes place.  
To answer this, it is helpful to go back to that earlier phase in history which is commonly  
referred to as the industrial revolution (Hamelink, 1999, p.172).  
In the case of long quotations, the reference should always be placed in brackets at the end of the  
quotation.  
Page Numbering  
Numbering should begin on the first page of the report proper, i.e. the Introduction. Page numbers  
should be placed at the bottom centre of the page.Figures, illustrations, etc.  
Any illustrations, figures, charts or diagrams should be placed in the text as close as possible to the  
first point at which they are mentioned. They should be drawn clearly and each type of illustration  
should be numbered consecutively throughout the report, e.g. Figure 1.1 \- Figure 10.3, Table 1.1 \-  
Table 6.4. Try to ensure, where possible, that illustrations and tables fit onto one page, and take care  
that they do not run over from the bottom of a page to the top of the next. The source of illustrations  
(if taken from other works) should be given under the illustration, in the same style as references.  
Exceptionally, a large number of illustrations, each of which occupies a page, can be gathered together  
into an appendix at the end of the report. They should still be numbered consecutively, and the  
appendix should also be numbered.
