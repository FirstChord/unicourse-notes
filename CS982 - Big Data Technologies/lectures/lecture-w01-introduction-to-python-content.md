data technologies and tools,  
➢ Explain and evaluate the use of classical statistical techniques in modern  
data analysis contexts,  
➢ Assess the suitability of different data analysis methods and technologies for  
specific problem domains, considering both their capabilities and limitations.Assessments \- Summative  
➢ This module (weeks 1 to 5\) is fully assessed by one coursework  
❖ Release date: Mid of week 3 (Wednesday 8/10/2025),  
❖ Submission Date: start of week 7 (Tuesday 3/11/2025),

According to Vijay Cherukuri, CEO, Infolob on March 1, 2022 in Data Science:  
➢ Data is the Most Valuable Commodity for Businesses,  
➢ Petabytes of data are traversing networks worldwide every day,  
➢ Most companies have similar types of data,  
… and all of that data means big money\!\!  
Source from: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2022/03/data-valuable-commodity-businesses.htmlExamples of applications  
➢ Recommendation systems from Amazon, Netflix, and others,  
➢ Search systems like Google, Bing and others,  
➢ Trending topics on Twitter or other social media,  
➢ Supermarket consumer projected demand, but also used to push products in  
other domains,  
➢ Flood warnings and other environmental projections,  
➢ Etc. etc. etc.The myth vs. the Reality  
➢ Big Data will always directly translate into cash,  
➢ Due to recent technological advancements, there will be no challenges or  
limitations in Big Data,  
➢ Most of the work in Data science is related to ML modelsThe myth vs. the Reality

After formulating the problem, a significant component of any project, typically  
around 80%, involves understanding, cleaning, visualising and preparing the  
data, and it's absolutely essential to spend time on this before you even  
consider building a model.  
https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/Why Data preparation is critical  
➢ Garbage in, garbage out: If the input data is noisy, incomplete, unbalanced,  
or inconsistent, even the most sophisticated model will produce poor results.  
➢ Feature quality \> model choice: Well-engineered and meaningful features  
often improve performance more than swapping models.  
➢ Reproducibility & reliability: Proper preparation ensures that results are  
stable, consistent, and interpretable across runs.Why Data preparation is critical  
➢ Easier visualization & communication: Clear data makes it easier to generate  
visuals or reports that stakeholders can read & trust.  
➢ Error detection early: Exploratory analysis often reveals problems (e.g. data  
entry errors, unit mismatches, incorrect formats) before they cascade into  
bigger issues later in the project.  
➢ Efficiency in modelling: Clean, well-structured data reduces the complexity of  
training, speeds up computation, & avoids wasted cycles debugging bad inputs.Real-World Examples  
➢ Missing values (e.g. “unknown” coded as 999\) were mistakenly treated as real  
measurements, leading to misleading conclusions about patient risk factors.  
➢ A fraud detection model trained without handling class imbalance (fraud cases  
\<1% of transactions) produced a model that predicted “no fraud” almost all the  
time.  
➢ Customer churn models built on unclean CRM data (where one customer had  
multiple IDs across systems) failed because the same person was treated as  
multiple customers.Any questions so far?

➢ Provides good support for the kind of problems we will be looking at  
❖ huge number of libraries and contributed packages for dealing with statistics, visualisation,  
Machine Learning techniques, etc.  
❖ and particularly good at handling data,  
➢ Very popular language and used widely in industry for data science and data  
analytics tasks,  
➢ Easy to learn and implement,  
➢ Allows easy access and use of other technologies we will be usingPython Syntax  
➢ Python is divided into logical lines, where every line is ended by a NEWLINE token  
➢ Comments begin with the \# character and end at the NEWLINE token  
➢ If you want to write a longer line you can use the \\ character  
➢ You can write two separate statements into a single line using a ;  
➢ Python uses whitespace (spaces and tabs) to define program blocks  
➢ There are reserved words in the language that must be used for specific purposes, we  
will come across these as we progress  
➢ https://www.w3schools.com/python/What is an Algorithm?  
➢ An algorithm is a list of instruction, once executed correctly, will lead to the  
desired result,  
➢ It should contain only instructions that can be understood by the one who/that  
will execute it,  
➢ The methodical step-by-step checking of your algorithm represents more  
than half of the work to be done \!\!DNA vs. Computers  
➢ DNA, which is in a way the genetic program, the algorithm  
at the basis of the construction of human being, is a chain  
constructed from four invariable elements: adenine (A),  
guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T)DNA vs. Computers  
➢ DNA, which is in a way the genetic program, the algorithm  
at the basis of the construction of human being, is a chain  
constructed from four invariable elements: adenine (A),  
guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T)

understanding only four categories of instructions:

Python ScreenPython Variables  
➢ A variable is a memory location where a value can be stored  
➢ This value can be a string, a number, etc., e.g. “Joseph", 180, 99.999  
➢ Variables are created when first assigned  
➢ Once created, the value stored can be accessed or updated later  
➢ Python determines the variable type (string, int, float etc.)  
➢ Memory is allocated based on the data type of a variable  
➢ There are rules for naming variables:

➢ A branch is an instruction in a computer program that can cause a computer  
to begin executing a different instruction sequence and thus deviate from its

results in branching, or a conditional branch, which may or may not cause  
branching depending on some condition
